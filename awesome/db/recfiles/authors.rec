Name: Robert Stephen Virding
Location: Sweden
Presentations: Robert Virding recently joined Erlang Solutions Ltd as
+ Principal Language Expert. While at Ericsson AB, Robert Virding was
+ one of the original members of the Ericsson Computer Science Lab, and
+ co-inventor of the Erlang language. He took part in the original
+ system design and contributed much of the original libraries, as well
+ as to the current compiler. While at the lab he also did a lot of work
+ on the implementation of logic and functional languages and on garbage
+ collection. He has also worked as an entrepreneur and was one of the
+ co-founders of one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail). Robert
+ Virding also worked a number of years at the Swedish Defence Materiel
+ Administration (FMV) Modeling and Simulations Group. He co-authored
+ the first book (Prentice-Hall) on Erlang, and is regularly invited to
+ teach and present throughout the world. (from www.erlang-factory.com)

Name: Mike Calvin Williams
Presentations: Mike is originally from South Wales, but has in fact
+ lived in Sweden longer than he has anywhere else. Way back in the
+ 1960's after working as a Atheistic Missionary in Malawi, Mike went to
+ Cambridge where he learnt a lot about drinking beer and rather less
+ about "Mechanical Sciences". He then moved to Sweden in 1970 (guess
+ why :-) and joined Ericsson as a hardware designer. The price of beer
+ in Sweden being horrendously expensive enabled Mike to concentrate
+ more on other things, He joined with Bjarne DÃ¤cker to found the
+ Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory 1980. One of the things they did
+ in the Computer Science lab was to "invent" Erlang. Mike's role was to
+ develop the first Erlang virtual machine (Joe developed the compiler
+ and machine architecture). He worked out the primitives for fault
+ handling and dynamic code replacement In 1990 Mike glided into
+ management by a complete accident, and found he rather liked it. Since
+ then he has been in charge of both large and small units within
+ Ericsson which develop software. (from www.erlang-factory.com)

Name: Joe Louis Armstrong
Location: Sweden
Presentations: Joe Armstrong is one of the three co-inventors of
+ Erlang. When at the Ericsson computer science lab in 1986, he was part
+ of the team who designed and implemented the first version of
+ Erlang. He has written several Erlang books including Programming
+ Erlang Software for a Concurrent World. Joe held the first ever Erlang
+ course and has taught Erlang to hundreds of programmers and held many
+ lectures and keynotes describing the technology. Joe has a PhD in
+ computer science from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm,
+ Sweden and is an expert in the construction of fault tolerant
+ systems. Joe was the chief software architect of the project which
+ produced the Erlang OTP system. He has worked as an entrepreneur in
+ one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail) and has worked for 30
+ years in industry and research. (from www.erlang-factory.com)
